# Graph-based-image-segmentation-algorithm
Image Segmentation
This code demonstrates a simple implementation of graph-based image segmentation using the SLIC (Simple Linear Iterative Clustering) algorithm. The algorithm divides an image into visually meaningful segments based on color similarity.

Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy


Import the necessary libraries:
python
Copy code
import cv2
import numpy as np
Define the segment_image function, which performs the image segmentation:
python
Copy code
def segment_image(image_path, sigma=0.8, k=300, min_size=100):
    # Function code here
    ...
    return segmented_image
Test the image segmentation algorithm by providing an image path and calling the segment_image function:
python
Copy code
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
segmented_image = segment_image(image_path, sigma=0.8, k=300, min_size=100)

if segmented_image is not None:
    # Display the original image and segmented image
    cv2.imshow('Original Image', cv2.imread(image_path))
    cv2.imshow('Segmented Image', segmented_image)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
    cv2.destroyAllWindows()
Make sure to replace "path/to/your/image.jpg" with the actual path to your image file.

Run the script and observe the original image and the corresponding segmented image displayed in separate windows.
Parameters
The segment_image function accepts the following parameters:

image_path: The path to the input image file.
sigma: The desired sigma value for the SLIC algorithm (default: 0.8).
k: The desired region size for the SLIC algorithm (default: 300).
min_size: The minimum size of a segment (default: 100).

Feel free to adjust these parameters to achieve the desired segmentation results.
